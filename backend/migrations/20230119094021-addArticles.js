Our selection of six useful but lesser-known websites will boost your productivity, help you accomplish more throughout the day, and always stay one step ahead!</p><p>Who doesn\'t want to be productive and accomplish more in a day than their acquaintances? Unfortunately, no one can create a 25th hour in a day. That\'s why we\'re sharing a couple of services with you that will definitely help you plan your tasks and prioritize them effectively.</p><h3>1. Pomotodo https://pomotodo.com/intl/</h3><p>An effective technique for combating procrastination is the <b>Pomodoro technique</b>.

This method helps you focus better on your current tasks and prevents burnout. The Pomotodo app is an excellent tool that allows you to set timers, specify breaks, and track your progress.</p><h3>2. Noisli https://www.noisli.com/</h3>\n' +
                    '<p>If background noise in your workspace disrupts your concentration, you can download Noisli.</p><p>With Noisli, you can drown out distracting background noises and replace them with ambient melodies like a coffee shop, rain, wind, or waves. <b>These soothing sounds can help you focus on what\'s in front of you, significantly increase productivity, and prevent you from getting distracted by every background sound or noise.</b></p><p>You can customize the sounds you listen to, creating the perfect soundtrack for your work.

Habitica https://habitica.com/static/home</h3><p>An unconventional planning application offers a gamified approach to managing your to-do list. <b>Habitica is a pixelated game designed to motivate you in self-development.</b></p><p>All your tasks are missions that allow you to level up and improve your skills (there\'s even in-game currency).</p><h3>4. Notion https://www.notion.so/</h3><p>The developers of Notion decided not to limit themselves to just one thing and created an application that can replace Google Docs, Evernote, or Trello. In Notion, you can create notes, to-do lists, and also attach documents, tables, and create Kanban boards. You can add or remove elements in the app and build your perfect productivity tool.</p><h3>5. Workflow https://workflow.is/</h3><p>Workflow allows you to create shortcuts that automate a sequence of actions. For example, with a single button press, you can turn a web page into a PDF file or take three photos, convert them into a GIF, and send it in a message.

                text: '<h3>Smile</h3><p>Let\'s face the truth: we\'re not always happy. However, customer experience should be positive from the beginning. So smile, even if you don\'t feel like it. Positive thinking and sales experts often use the expression "Fake It Until You Make It," and it fits best for this point. And the ancient Chinese, who were well aware of the intricacies of human relationships, said, "A person without a smile should not open a shop."</p><h3>Listen attentively</h3><p>People love to talk about themselves. Show genuine interest in someone\'s hobbies or area of expertise. Such attention will have a positive effect on the person you\'re talking to, and you can learn a lot of new things.</p><h3>Body Language and Eye Contact</h3><p>Avoiding eye contact is a clear sign that you lack confidence and feel nervous. It doesn\'t mean that you should constantly stare into the other person\'s eyes without blinking - it\'s enough to periodically reestablish eye contact for about 3 seconds.</p><p>If you\'re having a face-to-face conversation with a client, it\'s important that your body language supports an atmosphere of readiness to help and attentiveness. Pay attention to your posture and facial expressions.</p><p>Have you ever noticed that people engaged in conversation tend to mimic each other\'s movements and facial expressions? It\'s a way to gauge how well the connection is established. Try changing your sitting position or crossing your legs and observe how the person reacts.</p><h3>Attire</h3><p>By dressing better than the situation requires, you show that you take the meeting seriously and are determined. Of course, appearance is not everything, but "people judge others by their appearance..."</p><h3>Punctuality</h3><p>Punctuality is the foundation of showing respect. If you have a business meeting, remember the unwritten rule: "Arriving on time is already late." Always allow extra time for unexpected events. If you do end up running late, be sure to call the client and let them know. They will accept it only if you apologize and show them that you care.</p>',

                text: '<p>Many people are afraid to enter the freelance market due to high competition. After all, if everyone becomes a social media marketer, who will they promote? And in the past, there were few programmers, they all found their niche, but now there\'s no point in trying because everyone is running towards IT.</p><p>Initially, it\'s challenging for every freelancer to stand out among others because some specialists already have reviews and portfolios, some are willing to do the work at a lower price, and it\'s not uncommon to come across authors willing to write an article in exchange for a review. To truly stand out among other freelancers, you need to work hard, develop your skills, gain experience, and eventually build a base of regular clients who can recommend you. To achieve this, read books, attend courses and seminars, engage in relevant communities and forums, and stay updated with the latest trends in the freelance market to always stay ahead.</p><h3>Is competition beneficial for clients?</h3><p><b>Competition allows clients to choose and save.</b> It depends on the client and their expectations. If someone is initially looking for the cheapest option and doesn\'t care about quality, then competition and price dumping among freelancers are advantageous for them. An experienced client understands that quality work cannot be cheap, and to save their own nerves and time, it\'s better to approach a specialist from the start. Sometimes clients choose professionals based on reviews and portfolios, but their cost is too high, so the client may indicate the possibility of getting the work done just as well, but at a much lower price. An experienced freelancer won\'t fall for such tricks and won\'t lower their price because in practice, it can be observed that such clients end up paying twice or even three times. In the end, they seek help from a specialist and no longer discuss the cost of the work because they are willing to pay any amount.</p><h3>How can freelancers compete with each other?</h3><p>On freelance marketplaces, there are many opportunities to improve your account and create a high-quality portfolio, and paid access is designed specifically for conscientious freelancers who are serious about finding new clients. However, even beginner freelancers can pay for various privileges, so this method of filtering doesn\'t work.</p><p>In any case, individuals should strive to improve their professional and communication skills to always remain competitive and stand out from the crowd.</p>',

Any self-respecting person, especially a "green" designer with some knowledge and skills, should understand that giving away your time for free is a futile endeavor. Yes, they may not be a Senior or even a Middle designer yet, but that doesn\'t prevent them from asking for payment for their work.</p><p>Remember that any free work equals a direct path to burnout and undervaluing yourself.
